Marketing and Sales Directors,ChaChing,USA,"Join Us to Cut the Cost ofJoin Us to Cut the Cost of Living Crisis for ALL American Families Our story.... Google, Meta, and Amazon get paid to show you products. They charge merchants high fees for this — and those costs get passed on to you in the form of higher prices. Merchants who don’t pay these gatekeepers — even if they offer much lower prices — never get seen by consumers. The result? Americans are paying far more than they should for things they buy online. That’s where we come in. We built www (dot) price-fighter (dot) com The first website that shows ALL prices online, from low to high for a specific item. On average, the lowest prices we display are 30–50% lower than the average of those prices you’ll typically be shown on Google, Meta, or Amazon. We believe 30-50% price reductions can make a real difference for struggling families across America. If we can cut the cost of living by sharing information on better prices, we can all do better — together. ____________________________ To make this happen, we’re looking to hire a large team of campus ambassadors to spread the word and bring this tool to every household in the country.

Founding Engineer ,Rey,Europe,"Rey is a tool that lets anyone build mobile apps visually. We believe in a world where the power of software creation is accessible to everyone, not just those with specialised skills or financial resources. With Rey, we’re starting with apps for smartphones, the most universal computing devices today. We're currently in closed beta with 3 pilot customers and 2 apps already live on the app stores ( Lume and Recharge ). Today, users can already use Rey to design interfaces, define interactions, connect to built-in databases, and deploy to the app stores. But this is just the beginning. As a team, we'll continue to take on complex design and engineering challenges — from expanding our building block library, to automating deployment pipelines, to building AI copilot experiences. If you’re excited by hard problems and big mission, this is the perfect time to join us. About the role You’ll be the first full-time engineer at Rey. That means shaping not just our codebase, but also our culture, team, and product. We’re looking for someone who thrives in an environment where speed and ownership matter.

Experience with cross-platform frameworks like Flutter is a plus. You bring some backend experience (Java, Ruby, Elixir, or similar), or you’re eager to pick it up as we grow. You take pride in your craft: You care about building high-quality, scalable user experiences for a large audience, and think critically about the impact on users’ lives. You're adaptable and resourceful: You’re comfortable tackling new challenges and learning on the fly. You have confidence to ship fast: You can scope tightly, ship frequently, and value momentum over perfection. You can build and lead a team: You will recruit, coach and develop our engineering team. You know how to create a supportive, empowering and challenging work environment — one where people can do their best work. You’re based in Berlin or ±2 hours of CEST/CET, and willing to travel to Berlin to work together in person a few times a year.

Social Media Manager/Shitposter @ Fun Ecom Co | Great People & Flexible Hours,JLS Trading Co,Worldwide,"- Do you have trouble communicating through anything but memes? - Did you livestream your family staging an intervention for your social media addiction? - Do you thrive in a high-stress environment filled with political infighting, bureaucracy, and corporate nonsense? If so, then we are the place for you, except you might hate how nice of a company we have - filled with happy, generally competent people that don’t put up with jerks. Frankly, it makes me sick how nice everyone is. We are remote full time, have very flexible hours, people are judged by their output, not by how much they suck up to the boss, and turnover is super low because the company believes that happy employees = happy customers = happy bank account. Simply disgusting, if you ask me. --Is this a real job ad?-- Yup! Amazingly enough, we actually paid money to post this on a bunch of different job sites. And it’s not even a pyramid scheme! Plus, get this: the owner just started paying our 70ish employees with money instead of Pizza Hut coupons - we’re big time, people. Our careers page is actually worth checking out to learn more about how insane we are (sidenote: it won a web design award in 1993 - we’re a pretty big deal): http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ And check out our reviews on Google , Glassdoor , or Indeed to see that it’s not just the founder’s mother who says we’re cool. --What do you guys do?-- We do a lot of different things these days including selling awesome consumer products (these are just a small sampling): - Bad Parking Cards ( https://amz.run/5Eya ) - Beverage Barricades ( https://amz.run/6kip ) - Child Chucker ( https://amz.run/9EUz ) Running this Amazon Pay-Per-Click agency: PPCFarm.com (we’re really, really good at PPC) And we will soon be launching a SaaS product for inventory management. We are doing our best to grow rapidly every year, and it’s our intention to continue that for as long as possible, which means we need good people to help us keep up with the growth. --What is your company like?-- 1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk smack to the CEO (highly encouraged), and no one will think anything of it. You don't have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you're not - you can just be you. 2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing $100 million annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done. 3. Full Time Remote/Flexible Hours. You will be working from home in your pajamas, on your schedule. And we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or 6 hours a day and catch up over the weekend. So long as you get a lot of work done, we’re happy campers. 4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking-to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest. 5. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. 6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you. 7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes] 8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here. 9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year. 10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier. 11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it. 12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor! 13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor. --What are your company’s values?-- See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/ Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us. --OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?-- No. --Wait... What?-- OK fiiine. Helping to make our social media presence 1000x less shitty by being a reply guy, shitposting, responding to comments on our posts, and doing whatever else you can to create raving fans of our brands ( Witty Yeti will be your primary project at the start). We are very early in our social media exploration/development and what we are doing now isn’t enough. We want to absolutely crush, and need your knowledge and sense of humor to help get there. You’re gonna be tasked with pulling all the levers you reasonably can to grow our social media - we’re not expecting you to make videos yourself (unless you want to), but want you to shitpost and comment and help with creative ideation (let’s hop on this trend real quick, this meme would be hilarious, etc). You’re basically gonna be a social media generalist - doing whatever is necessary (within reason, of course) to help us be successful in reaching The People™. Maybe it’s updating our page, maybe it’s making some thumbnails (we can teach you), maybe it’s responding with the perfect GIF, maybe it’s crafting new copy pasta for someone who tweeted the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever heard. We’ll see how it shakes out and very much want to set you up for success, and the right strategy will require your input before we set anything in stone. We’ll likely just feel our way through trying to find the thing(s) that work. Like everyone else in the company, you will also need to innovate regularly - which means figuring out ways to improve quality and production speed. --Do I need experience?-- We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred). Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon. Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato. Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95. I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for a social media job... sickening. I’m literally shaking right now. Also, no you don't need any experience. We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though. --Do I need a college degree?-- You just need to be awesome. --Are there any geographic restrictions?-- As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so… --What are your social media accounts?-- This will give you an idea of what we’re currently doing: https://www.tiktok.com/@wittyyeti.com https://www.instagram.com/witty.yeti/ --I know a ton about social media but haven’t “run” it before-- As long as you are willing to learn (from others because we have no clue what we’re doing), then you’ll be fine. We have lots of people in the company who never did their role before and we just paid them to learn, and now they do great. --This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.-- You sound just like the tax authorities! --That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?-- Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No. There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us. Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder). Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!",https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/marketing/social-media-manager-shitposter-fun-ecom-co-great-people-flexible-hours-2057112
